Job Summary

Extend is a virtual credit card distribution platform that reimagines how credit cards are issued, distributed and accessed. We partner directly with the card networks and banks to enhance their core offerings. We enable business cardholders to instantly send digital credit cards to employees and freelancers and more without ever exposing their original card number or losing control over spend. Extend is an early stage, venture-backed startup based in New York City. Join us on our journey as we redefine how people think about credit cards and spend management.

Job Responsibilities

You will make an impact. We’re a small team and we get a lot done with very few resources. You’ll work directly with the founders and the primary architects of the platform (and some other awesome folks – many of whom have 15+ years of experience in their fields) on some really cool payments technology (all built in-house) and will own everything you do--from the start of your internship right up to your final day.

You’ll take on different projects that are critical to Extend – from devising advanced analytical dashboards in Tableau (leveraging SQL), to transforming real-time the information that we receive from card networks to offer a better user experience to users. You’ll need to understand how customers interact daily with Extend, both user-facing (ES6 React web application, or our native iOS or Android applications), and behind-the-scenes integrations and web services (written in Kotlin) – and how our data is structured across card issuers and networks. Extend is mobile and API first - one of our mottos is “API as UI”.

We take pride in our work and you should too. You’ll learn how we stay productive in a startup environment despite working remotely. You’ll learn how to build things that customers love--while also paying careful attention to writing beautiful, maintainable code you’d be happy to put up on the wall to show off to your friends.
You’ll learn to build things customers actually need, not just what they tell you they need.
You’ll learn to ship early and often.
You’ll build to throw away, and don’t get too tied to anything you create because you know the next thing’s going to be even better.
You’ll learn the ability to say “No” and will actively fight against feature creep.
You’ll learn to effectively hide the internal complexity behind elegant and simple interfaces.
You’ll learn how to be opinionated and express your personal preferences - but also not to limit your decisions based on them.
You’ll teach us how AI and data science can bring Extend to the next level
You’ll learn that we’re all Ninja/Pirate/Rockstar/Unicorns given the right environment and opportunity.

Over the past 25 years, we grew from startup to $2.75 billion in annual revenue and are confident that we still have a huge, multi-year growth opportunity ahead of us. Our confidence is driven by two primary factors: firstly, ~80% of the market segment for small businesses’ marketing materials is still served through traditional offline channels, often lacking the convenience and cost advantages from greater scale that we can offer our customers. Secondly, there is a significant opportunity to accelerate our activity in adjacent product segments such as packaging, apparel, signage, or corporate line of business accounts. We are a profitable business with an entrepreneurial mindset, and throughout our history we have proven our commitment to investing for long-term horizons.

Data Science Instructor,$91K-$148K (Glassdoor est.),"Highly qualified candidates may be eligible for a sign on bonus for this position.

ABOUT THIS POSITION

This is a position for a Data Science Instructor for the Air Force Institute of Technology (AFIT). Candidate must be a graduate in the data sciences field (statistics, computer science, information technology, math, or other related technical field). Candidate will help develop and instruct students at the AFIT School of Systems Acquisition and Logistics by developing, testing, maintaining and delivering training programs and related materials in support of relatively complex products and procedures. Candidate establishes and/or reviews course content and objectives and may provide work leadership for lower level employees, including evaluating the effectiveness of their training presentations and programs. Must be eligibility for a government Common Access Card (CAC), including favorable completion of a National Agency Check.

A successful candidate for the Instructor of Data Analysts will demonstrate these characteristics:

Creativity. Statistical analysis is only one part of the job. Understanding the evolving world of business is the doorway to relating the technical to the applied.

Curiosity. Top-notch data analysts look for the meaning-the ""why""-behind the numbers. Instructors need to impress that on students. One way to do that is to understand why the student is there in the first place, then relate the material to the student's needs.

Goal orientation. A strategic perspective. Organize the material in a logical way so that advanced concepts build upon simpler ones. If the student hits a wall, the instructor can focus on the component the student has difficulty mastering.

Effective communication. The capacity to tell a story. The instructor is more effective if the material is presented in a narrative that is memorable and lends itself to a process of beginning, middle and end.

Continuous learning. Willing to be intellectually challenged. The instructor should understand the needs of the students, at their various levels of mastery, and related the evolving technical resources to the evolving application in business.

Comfort with the logic in programming (breaking the complex into the simple). Programming, statistical, technical expertise or a willingness to improve existing knowledge. A personal understanding of the material makes it easier to relate it to a student when the explanation needs to be reframed for the student's benefit.

REQUIRED QUALIFICATIONS:

Skills required for this job are Bachelor's Degree and 5 years of training experience or a masters degree and 3 years experience. Candidate must possess the ability to perform effective oral and written communication to students in a classroom. Previous experience teaching professional continuing education courses and/or research assistance experience desired.

Chair of Responsible Data Science,$53K-$94K (Glassdoor est.),"The University of Virginia (UVA) School of Data Science (SDS)has an exciting opportunity for a tenured associate or full professor or an academic general faculty professor, on the practice track, who will also serve as the inaugural Quantitative Foundation Endowed Chair of Responsible Data Science. This is a pivotal position in the development of the School, which was founded with support from the Quantitative Foundation, the largest gift in the university’s 200 year history. A start date is negotiable until August 2021.

As we move to a data-centric society, SDS seeks to distinguish itself through the definition and practice of responsible data science. Such an outcome requires close cooperation between STEM, social science, humanities, policy and law, leading to the iterative development of a culture of responsibility around data and computation. This helps to create a culture that promotes societal benefit and works to educate all stakeholders as to the nefarious as well as unintentional possibilities of the use of data science methods and techniques. The strengths of the UVA in developing global thinkers, trained to be socially responsible leaders makes it an ideal place for responsible data science and a new form of higher education exemplified by the School of Data Science - a “School without Walls.”

The Chair of Responsible Data Science will assume directorship for the fledgling, yet resourced, Center for Data Ethics and Justice within the School. The School does not have departments but rather centers that can be nimble in a rapidly changing field. Responsibilities include maintaining an internationally recognized research program, recruiting faculty and students to build out the program, contributing to the educational mission of the School as we expand an existing Masters in Data Science as well as develop PhD and undergraduate programs. As Center Director, the Chair of Responsible Data Science will become part of the leadership team of the School and play a vital role in shaping its future. The Director position carries with it a 5-year renewable endowed appointment. Depending on the background and interests of the individual, joint or courtesy appointments with other Schools, for example, Law, Batten School of Leadership and Public Policy, or the College of Arts and Sciences will be encouraged.

In summary, this important pioneering and possibly non-traditional hire represents a unique opportunity to shape a School committed to pushing the envelope in higher education in a field of unprecedented growth and opportunity where the meaning of responsible data science, while recognized of great import, is yet to be fully defined. The expectation is that the successful candidate will not only be a leader in the field of responsible data science, but also help shape what that means.

Requirements:

Recognizing that the field of data science is in its formative stage, we are interested in applications from a variety of individuals from academia, government, the private sector and non-profits who are considered influential thought leaders at the interface of STEM and humanities. Desirable prerequisites include:
National and international recognition in related research and/or application, including a public-facing track record of achievement
A demonstrated commitment to advancing diversity, equity and inclusion
A demonstrated successful experience, or strong promise, in implementing programs, policies and procedures around academic research and education at all levels
A proven ability, or strong promise, to help envision and build an organization
An ability to effectively manage direct reports and lead in a highly team-oriented and interdisciplinary environment
Highly effective verbal and written skills; ability to engage in collaborative communication, facilitate discussions and bring groups to consensus
Expertise in and ability to develop clear written policies, procedures and directions
A commitment to the development of student (undergraduate, graduate and life-long learners) focused services and/or programming
To be considered for the tenured full Professor (or Associate/full Professor) appointment, candidates must:
A terminal degree (e.g., PhD, JD, MD) in an appropriate STEM, social science or humanities field is required to be considered for a tenured appointment at the rank of Associate/Professor
To be considered for the academic general faculty Professor (Practice track), candidates must:
Equivalent experience is required to be considered for academic general faculty (AGF) on the practice track, at the rank of Professor
Sustained excellence in integrating professional experience with the academic mission of the school, and possess recognition for regional, national, or international achievements in the relevant professional field(s). Ability to integrate professional experience into academic instruction or scholarly research, national or international contributions to the integration of professional experience with academic instruction or scholarly research.

Data Science Mission Head,$38K-$80K (Glassdoor est.),"The Data Science Mission Office (DSMO) advances state-of-the-art data science at STScI and in the wider astronomical community. We work at the intersection of astronomical research, data science, engineering, and open source software development. We lead strategic programs to increase the scientific productivity of our missions, to realize the potential of data-driven astronomy, and to innovate in these areas. We develop institutional and broad community expertise by in combining data science and astronomy, exploring new technologies and services, as well as building and maintaining world-leading data management infrastructure and services to support past, current, and future NASA missions.

STScI is responsible for many of the highest-value datasets in astronomy, from NASA's flagship observatories including the Hubble Space Telescope, the James Webb Space Telescope, and the Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope, as well as community missions such as TESS. Our data archives in the Mikulski Archive for Space Telescopes (MAST) house more than 2 petabytes of multi-mission, multi-wavelength data from more than 20 community missions, and MAST is recognized as the premier NASA astronomical archive. DSMO works to expand the scientific value of these holdings and to use them to support astronomy that is inclusive.

The Role:

As the Mission Head you will lead the DSMO team and own the overall strategy for data science at STScI. One significant component of this effort is to enhance research activities, capabilities, and outcomes with in-house astronomers and a broad astronomical community, especially those based on the space missions and archives we support. A second component of the STScI data science mission is to improve operations of, and services provided by STScI through modern data management, data engineering, and data science techniques.

As a member of the senior leadership team of STScI, you will work with other leaders to identify and exploit science-enhancing harmonies across our missions. You will set priorities to explore and deliver new technologies, services, and infrastructures that advance scientific discovery.

The DSMO Mission Head requires a combination of""hands-on"" activities, together with delegating work to other team members and organizational units. Given the wide scope of DSMO, both STScI strategic priorities and the Mission Head's individual talents will shape the focus of the role.

By its nature, STScI’s data science mission is broad, and as a result, we welcome candidates with a diverse mix of skills and backgrounds to apply.

We are looking for candidates who:
Have significant experience in one or more of the key areas relevant to STScI’s data science mission including: data science, data-driven astronomy, and software and data engineering.

Thrive in an environment that gives you the freedom to explore a wide range of areas relevant to our data science mission. You recognize that the responsibility to create and realize a vision requires developing consensus from key partners, turning this vision into meaningful activities, and delivering results.
Communicate well, in multiple ways and with diverse groups of people. You are able to work seamlessly with the full range of an organization, engaging effectively with individuals, teams, and management. You are comfortable representing the work of STScI to external partners such as government agencies (e.g. NASA), advisory and oversight committees, and the scientific community.
Take a strategic perspective to identify and advance high-level priorities. You have demonstrated success in your past leadership roles.
Have a Ph.D., equivalent degree, or comparable experience in astronomy, computer science, engineering, or a related field. You would effectively utilize some of your working time for self-directed research.
How to apply:

Applicants should submit the following materials in a single PDF file: a cover letter, a curriculum vitae and bibliography, a 2–3 page summary of current and future interests in research or intellectual innovation, and contact information for three professional references. Candidates should take advantage of the cover letter to describe their particular interest in leading DSMO at STScI, a brief vision to use the role to advance scientific discovery, and expertise that would support their success in the position.

At WPI the boundaries to multidisciplinary collaboration are low --- faculty members, students, and other partners work together on real-world projects and purposeful research. We are most proud of a recent No. 1 ranking for ""faculty who best combine research and teaching."" (Wall Street Journal/Times Higher Ed, 2016).

Located in the heart of New England, WPI is surrounded by cultural and recreational opportunities. The UMass Medical Center, a large number of technology companies and many colleges and universities are located in the immediate area making it ideal for two-career families.

New York Life, the largest writer of retail life insurance in the U.S. and a top player in annuities, long-term care and mutual funds, is seeking a Delivery Design leader in its Center for Data Science and Artificial Intelligence (CDSAi).

The company has 175 years of history and while usable data does not quite go back that far, we have a wealth of internal information on consumers, policies and their performance, as well as applicants, prospects and our 12,000 agents. We also have a multitude of external data from a great variety of sources. New York Life is likely the most data-rich company in the life insurance industry.

We have a modern computing environment with a solid suite of data science/modeling tools and packages, and a large (but manageable) group of well-trained professionals at various levels to support you.

"Senior/Principal Scientist, Human Data Science",$58K-$167K (Glassdoor est.),"We make healthy cells invisible to targeted therapies

Targeted therapies work by attacking cells that express particular proteins on their surface. Unfortunately, both diseased and healthy cells often express the same proteins, resulting in collateral damage to healthy cells.

At Vor, we engineer hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) to lack a biologically redundant target protein, then transplant these cells into the patient.

These eHSCs give rise to generations of new healthy blood cells that are effectively invisible to targeted therapies. Diseased cells displaying the target protein and are then vulnerable to attack. This process potentially broadens the therapeutic window and improves the utility of complementary targeted therapies.

This search spans all areas of the data science including artificial intelligence, machine learning, data management and their applications and systems. For review purposes, candidates must submit an application to one of the following four broad areas of search that list topics of current interests, but are not limited to those listed.

A) Statistical Foundations of Data Science, Applied Statistics and Biostatistics
Statistical foundations of data science is one of the critical areas for hiring. Statistics (including Biostatistics) is the science of drawing inferences from data, thus forming a pillar of the emerging discipline of data science, together with Machine Learning. While both Statistics and Machine Learning are seeking optimal procedures for inference, e.g. prediction, the latter is more focused on algorithms and their computation/implementation, while the former is crucially entasked with quantifying the accuracy of such inference. Topics of current interest in Statistics include (but are not limited to): High-dimensional data, Large-scale Hypothesis Testing, Regularization and Sparsity, Functional Data, Causal inference, Complex Data, Dependent Data, Inference after model selection, Prediction Intervals, quantification of statistical significance and control of false discovery rate.

B) Digital and Data Infrastructure including Security
We invite candidates who build and study software systems and software-hardware integrated systems that serve as platforms to enable and amplify the impact of data science algorithms and applications. Our focus spans the whole lifecycle of digital data infrastructure, including (but not restricted to) systems for sensing and sourcing data, systems for storing, querying, learning, and analytics over data, streaming methods for analyzing very large datasets and systems for securely deploying data science methods in high-impact application verticals. Across this lifecycle, concerns of scalability, security, and usability will receive special attention. Examples of research areas that fit this focus include database and analytics systems, information integration and knowledge base construction, data mining and network/graph analytics, Internet of Things and cyber-physical systems, spatiotemporal information systems, cloud computing for data science, secure machine learning, database security. Examples of high-impact application verticals include smart and connected health, smart cities, e-commerce platforms, and social media platforms.

C) Artificial Intelligence, AI in Science Applications
We seek faculty candidates with a background in artificial intelligence or machine learning. This area includes, but is not exclusive to: natural language processing, computer vision, modeling high dimensional data with low intrinsic dimension, modeling dynamical systems, streaming methods for analyzing very large datasets, active learning, methods for incorporating machine learning into real-world systems that combine humans and machines, neural networks/deep-learning, reinforcement learning, optimization. We are interested in candidates with a strong applications emphasis as well as those that study the theoretical properties of the algorithms. Priority will be given to those who show a strong connection and relevance to data science.

D) Data Science in Public Policy
We seek faculty candidates with a background in statistics, computer science, economics, or public policy who are dedicated to exploring the use, risks, and benefits of data science for a well-defined vertical application area: such as democratic practice, media, trade in digital services, health, education, and societal infrastructure for energy, communication, transportation, and national security. Of particular interest will be candidates who are pursuing advances in theory, methods and tools that help us understand the opportunities and challenges that digital data pose to markets, organizations, society, and government; and (or) who are devising methods and evaluating policies to advance these opportunities and address these challenges, while considering both technical constraints and constraints related to social, political and economic feasibility.

A PhD in Computer Science, Math, Economics, Engineering or related discipline is required.

Successful applicants will be expected to teach graduate and undergraduate students in the Data Science major/minor degree programs offered by the Institute. In case of a partial joint appointment with another department, the teaching workload would include appropriate course work in the participating department. All candidates are expected to establish a vigorous program of high-quality federally funded research that focuses on innovations in one of the targeted search areas.

The preferred candidate will have demonstrated strong leadership or a commitment to support diversity, equity and inclusion in an academic setting. The level of appointment and salary is commensurate with qualifications and based on UC pay schedules.
